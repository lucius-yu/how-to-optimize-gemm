    "Practical implementations of Strassen's algorithm switch to standard methods of matrix multiplication for small enough submatrices, for which those algorithms are more efficient. The particular crossover point for which Strassen's algorithm is more efficient depends on the specific implementation and hardware. Earlier authors had estimated that Strassen's algorithm is faster for matrices with widths from 32 to 128 for optimized implementations.[2] However, it has been observed that this crossover point has been increasing in recent years, and a 2010 study found that even a single step of Strassen's algorithm is often not beneficial on current architectures, compared to a highly optimized traditional multiplication, until matrix sizes exceed 1000 or more, and even for matrix sizes of several thousand the benefit is typically marginal at best (around 10% or less).[3] A more recent study (2016) observed benefits for matrices as small as 512 and a benefit around 20%.[4]\n",

    "### How Strassen algorithm is discovered\n",
    "\n",
    "We do not know how strassen discovered this algorithm. But in the book [introduction to algorithm], a possible way to discover this kind of alogithm has been described. So, please refer to the book if you are intreseted.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another way to find possible formula for matrix muplication is described on the stackexchange. I think it required some math which I do not know.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Apart from Strassen, nobody is able to tell you how Strassen has got his idea. However, I can tell you, how you could have found that formula yourself—provided that you are interested in algebraic geometry and representation theory. This also gives you the tools to show that Strassen's formula is as good as it can, or more precisely, that there is no formula computing the product of two 2×2 matrices that uses fewer than 7 multiplications.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since you are interested by matrices I assume you know basic linear algebra and will be a bit blurry for the more advanced details.\n",
    "\n",
    "First let be E the set of all linear maps from a plane to a plane. This is basically the set of all 2×2 matrices, but we forget about a particular coordinate system—because, if there were a better coordinate system than the “default one” we could have interest in using it for matrix multiplication. We also denote by E† the dual space of E and by X = P(E⊗E†⊗E†) the projective space associated to the tensor product E⊗E†⊗E†.\n",
    "\n",
    "An element of X = P(E⊗E†⊗E†) of the special form [c⊗α⊗β] can be interpreted as an elementary operation on matrices, which, in some appopriate coordinate systems, reads a coefficient of a matrix A and a coefficient of a matrix B and writes the product of these coefficients in some matrix C. A general element of X is a combination of these elementary operations, so the product π of two matrices, understood as a map from P(E)×P(E) to P(E), is a point in X.\n",
    "\n",
    "The usual matrix product formula and Strassen's formula can be expressed as combinations of these linear operations, so let me denote by W₁ the set of these elementary operations [c⊗α⊗β] and let me describe geometrically their combinations.\n",
    "Let W₂ be the variety of secants of W₁ in X. It is obtained by taking the (closure of the) union of all lines going through two (generic) points of W₁. We can think of a it as of the set of all combinations of two elemetary operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let W₃ be the variety of secant planes of W₁ in X. It is obtained by taking the (closure of the) union of all planes going through three (generic) points of W₁. We can think of a it as of the set of all combinations of three elemetary operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly, we define secant varieties for greater indices. Note that these varieties grow larger and larger, that is W₁⊂W₂⊂W₃⊂⋯ Hence the classical matrix product formula shows that the product of matrices is a point of W₈. Actually\n",
    "\n",
    "PROPOSITION(Strassen) — The product of matrices π lies in W₇.\n",
    "\n",
    "As far as I know, Strassen did not put things that way, however this is a geometric point of view on this question. This point of view is very useful, because it also lets you prove that Strassen's formula is the best, that is, that π does not lie in W₆. Geometric methods developped here can also be used for a broader range of problems.\n",
